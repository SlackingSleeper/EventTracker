## Features
- Precise time tracking of various events (e.g. killing an enemy, discarding a weapon card)
- Comparing times to recorded personal bests
- Customizable sidebar display (X/Y/padding/entry count)
- Saving tracked events to disk as easily readable files (in the ghost directory as `tracker.txt` and others)
- Scrolling end display
  - Can be set to only display at the end of a run, as can PB differences

## Installation

1. Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest) and install it onto your `Neon White.exe`.
2. Run the game once. This will create required folders.
3. Download the **Mono** version of [Melon Preferences Manager](https://github.com/Bluscream/MelonPreferencesManager/releases/latest), and put the .DLLs from that zip into the `Mods` folder of your Neon White install.
    - The preferences manager is required to customize the event tracker, using F5 (by default).
4. Download `EventTracker.dll` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/stxticOVFL/EventTracker/releases/latest) and drop it in the `Mods` folder.

### Additional Notes
It's recommended to add add `--melonloader.hideconsole` to your game launch properties (Steam -> Right click Neon White -> Properties -> Launch Options) to hide the console that MelonLoader spawns.
